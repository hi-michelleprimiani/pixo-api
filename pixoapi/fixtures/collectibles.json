Each biome has a different ecology, and gives unique rewards when it is healthy and balanced. But watch out, your opponents may decide it's easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystems than nurture their own. In this hectic environment, you must choose how best to protect and care for your ecologies.\n\nDesigned by a biology teacher, the game includes 77 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total)\n\nPlayers: 1-6\nAges: 12+ (8+ with included simplified rules)\nTime: 60-90 minutes\nGame Modes: Standard, Simplified, Single Player\n\nThe goal is to build healthy food webs in different biomes. If you create a healthy ecology you are rewarded with the perks and powers of that biome. Each organism card lists what it eats and what it’s eaten by. Cards are arranged with plants on the bottom, predators on top. There is a trade mechanic similar to Catan where players trade with others based on what their individual needs are. It is a race to get 12 victory points and different organisms give different points. There are biotic/abiotic factor cards that can affect opponents and different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or disrupting other ecologies.\n\nThe game takes inspiration from titles like Settlers of Catan, Agricola, and Dominion. The gameplay is rooted in authentic science, as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students.

These places can easily be degraded into desert like conditions or nurtured to be greener and more productive. It depends on how the land is managed.\n\nIn this two player game the desert player competes with the forest player to decide the outcome of a small section of drylands.\n\nThe gameplay and strategy is abstract, reminiscent of Othello, Go, or Reversi, where the objective is to flip opponent tiles.\n\nEach turn players can “grow” by placing a new tile next to their established tiles, or they can “leap” using an existing tile to move to a location farther away.\n\nWhenever you place one of your tiles next to opponent tiles, either through growing or leaping, those opponent tiles flip and become yours.\n\nThis is made slightly more complicated by one-way barrier tiles (rivers and mountains) that block the path of players. Forest tiles can leap over rivers, but not mountains. Desert tiles can leap over mountains, but not rivers.\n\nA game that’s easy to learn but hard to master, it is suitable for a wide range of ages, from 5 to 105.\n\nIn the box is a large quad fold game board (14.5\"x14.5\") and five rigid tile sheets (20 tiles per sheet = 100 tiles total) You actually only need 4 tile sheets to play the game, but we included an extra sheet of tiles because we know small pieces are easy to lose and we wanted players to have plenty of extra tiles just in case.",

      "description": "Our 1000 piece “Hidden Habitat” puzzle features the same vintage art used in our “Ecologies: Hidden Habitats” card game. It showcases a detailed intertidal scene full of diverse marine organisms.\n\nThis puzzle is very large, measuring 27.6 inches by 19.7 inches when finished.\n\nWe also use an anti-glare matte lamination process for the surface finishing to improve durability and cut out the shine of normal gloss varnish, making it easier to see the fine details.\n\nThe inner box features bonus biological facts about different marine animals, along with detailed art.\n\nThe thick cardboard pieces have a white backing and fit together well.\n\n* Warning: small parts. Not for children under 3 or any individuals who have a tendency to place inedible objects in their mouths.",
