My grandparents raised birds and my sister sold hamsters to the local pet store. I think the core of my personality was formed in gardens, tidepools, meadows, and mud puddles. As an adult, I wanted to share my love of the natural world and inspire the next generation to investigate all the life that surrounds us. I became a biology teacher and moved to the Pacific Northwest, where I engage my students in the classroom with homemade games based on the science we are learning. While my games are designed with students in mind, they are also heavily influenced by the variety of strategy board games I grew up playing. They are rooted in real science, but strategic enough to find a home in any game night rotation. My design process includes sourcing, colorizing, manipulating, and altering vintage art in the public domain until I've created a sort of digital collage that is printed on cards. Text and borders may come from a 1700s map, while organism art might be a combination of two lithograph prints from the 1800s. The result is a beautiful game that is equal parts strategic and instructive. I have been humbled by the community's generous reception of my games and look forward to designing expansions and sequels, as well as all new games, in the future. My instagram account provides updates on my progress and also shares my personal nature photography, along with interesting biology and ecology facts related to the photos. Thank you so much for your support and encouragement!", "location": "Portland, OR", "img_url": "https://i.etsystatic.com/isla/9991a0/39812774/isla_280x280.39812774_f3qa42di.jpg?version=0", "created_on": "2023-12-08"}}]
